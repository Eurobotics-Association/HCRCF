## 📌 1. Executive Summary

The **Human-Centered Robotics Compliance Framework (HCRC)** is an open, modular framework that defines the ethical, technical, physical, and legal compliance requirements for humanoid and social robots interacting with human beings in public and private settings.

As the integration of robotics and AI accelerates in areas such as **supermarket logistics**, **elderly assistance**, **education**, and **public services**, there is an urgent need for an auditable and internationally aligned framework. HCRC provides this by offering:

* ✅ **Clear compliance criteria** for ethics, safety, and cybersecurity
* 📜 **Alignment with global standards** such as ISO/IEC 27001, ISO 13482, GDPR, NIS2, and the EU AI Act
* 🧠 **Built-in architecture guidance** such as the ASMV subsystem to embed Asimov-inspired ethical safeguards
* 🔎 **Auditing and certification methodology** for regulators, manufacturers, and integrators
* 🫱🏼‍🫲🏾 **Open collaboration tools** for co-creating labels, declarations, and proof-of-compliance artifacts

This document presents **Version 0.1 (Draft)** and invites contributions from all stakeholders to co-develop the HCRC framework into a future **European or global standard** for ethical and secure social robotics.

## 🧭 2. Introduction

The Human-Centered Robotics Compliance Framework (HCRC) addresses the urgent need to regulate the growing field of social robotics and human-AI interaction. With deployments emerging in retail, elderly care, and public service, ensuring societal acceptance, regulatory compliance, and technical safety is paramount. The HCRC aims to bridge current gaps between ethics, law, and engineering by offering a modular, auditable approach.

## ⚖️ 3. The Importance of Ethical and Secure Social Robotics

Robots that interact with vulnerable populations must operate under ethical constraints and clear accountability. Drawing from the [Labelia Labs framework](https://github.com/LabeliaLabs/referentiel-evaluation-dsrc), HCRC expands ethical review into physical autonomy, intent prediction, and emotional response.

## 🏗️ 4. HCRC Framework Overview

The HCRC framework consists of modular domains: physical security, ethical design, cybersecurity, data governance, AI behavior control (ASMV architecture), compliance checklists, and lifecycle auditing. Each module can be audited independently but contributes to system-level compliance.

## 🛡️ 5. Physical Security and Human Safety

Guided by ISO 13482 and EN 80601 standards, this section covers collision avoidance, fall mitigation, tamper-resistance, and context-aware motion safety. Redundant sensors, fail-safe actions, and robot-initiated alerts are included in the design.

## 🤝 6. Human-Centered Ethical Principles

HCRC proposes minimum ethical rulesets for humanoid robots, including:

* Role-appropriate empathy and emotion modeling
* Avoidance of coercion or manipulation
* Transparent purpose declaration
* Adaptive boundaries based on human comfort
  Inspired by initiatives like the [Data Hazards project](https://datahazards.com).

## 🔐 7. Cybersecurity Standards: Integrating EU NIS2

NIS2 emphasizes supply chain security and real-time threat detection. HCRC-compliant robots must:

* Isolate mission-critical firmware
* Monitor anomalies in network behavior
* Support remote kill-switch via authenticated channel
* Apply ENISA-recommended IoT security baselines

## 🗄️ 8. Data Privacy and Management: GDPR, NIS2, and Beyond

User interaction logs, biometric inputs, and location data must be:

* Minimally retained
* Encrypted at rest and in transit
* Available for user opt-out or review
* Bound by purpose limitation clauses (GDPR Art. 5)

## 📋 9. Auditing and Compliance Methodologies

Inspired by ISO 27001 Annex A and the [Swiss Digital Trust Label](https://digitaltrust-label.swiss), the framework supports:

* Internal and external audit modes
* Pre-deployment validation
* Event-based compliance triggers
* Public transparency declarations for ethical scorecards

## 🧠 10. Integrating Asimov's Laws and the ASMV Compliance Architecture

Chapter introduces the **ASMV** (Autonomous Supervision & Moral Validator) concept: a separate companion computer that:

* Validates actions against encoded ethical constraints
* Monitors for contradictions to human command override
* Implements physical kill-switch logic
  This expands the “Three Laws” into machine-verifiable states.

## 🌐 11. Relationship with Existing International Standards

Includes mapping to:

* ISO/IEC 27001
* ISO/IEC 38507
* ISO/TC 299 (robotics)
* IEC 61508
* EU AI Act Title III (High-risk systems)

## 🚀 12. Case Studies and Pilot Implementations

Use cases:

* Supermarket assistant robot (shelf restocking + elderly support)
* School safety patrol bot
* Assisted living greeting + logistics bot
  Documented with KPI alignment and ethical score evolution.

## 📈 13. Future Roadmap and Research Directions

* Expand test environments
* Integrate with simulation tools (e.g., ROS + Gazebo)
* Push for EU-wide pre-certification program
* Develop ethical AI agents for third-party auditing

## 👥 14. Stakeholder Engagement and Collaborative Governance

We propose the creation of a “Social Robotics Ethics Forum” involving:

* Public regulators
* Accessibility experts
* Senior care associations
* Industry partners

## ⚠️ 15. Challenges, Limitations, and Mitigation Strategies

* Over-promising AI capabilities → transparent labeling
* Bias in training data → adversarial audits
* Lack of social acceptance → participatory design

## ✅ 16. Conclusion and Recommendations

Robots entering the public sphere must do so on human terms. The HCRC enables ethical-by-design AI deployment with certifiable guarantees. Its success depends on interdisciplinary collaboration and iterative refinement.
