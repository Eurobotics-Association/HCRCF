## 📌 1. Executive Summary

The **HCRC Framework** ensures social robotics and AI are introduced into society ethically, securely, and with full regulatory alignment. It addresses physical safety, ethics, cybersecurity, and data governance, aligned with **ISO**, **EU GDPR**, **NIS2**, and the **EU AI Act**.

---

## 🧭 2. Introduction

Outlines the framework's purpose, scope, and relevance in modern robotics. Provides a roadmap for ethical integration into real-world applications.

---

## ⚖️ 3. The Importance of Ethical and Secure Social Robotics

Covers the impact, risks, and need for auditable safeguards in human-robot interaction, especially in vulnerable or public contexts.

---

## 🏗️ 4. HCRC Framework Overview

Explains the multi-layered system comprising:

* Ethical Governance
* Physical Safety
* Cybersecurity (NIS2)
* Data Protection (GDPR)
* Compliance & Auditing

---

## 🛡️ 5. Physical Security and Human Safety

Design principles for safe robotics including emergency stops, collision detection, ergonomic design, and user awareness.

---

## 🤝 6. Human-Centered Ethical Principles

Promotes non-discrimination, transparency, autonomy, and ethical review boards. Includes a labeling system for ethical compliance.
